# 🏔 Serworm

This tiny application is a worm project. The app first connects to the specified auth server and requests the realm list. When it's complete, the server starts a local authentication server where you can connect with your client.

### Why serworm?
This project helps to decrypt/re-crypt the packet headers transfered between the server/client. In this way the packet dumper is ***undetectable*** by the client.
